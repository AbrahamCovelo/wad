Wad
===


Wad is a Javascript library for manipulating audio using the new HTML5 Audio API.  It greatly simplifies the process of creating, playing, and manipulating audio, either for real-time playback, or at scheduled intervals.  Wad provides a simple interface to use many features one would find in a desktop DAW (digital audio workstation), but doesn't require the user to worry about sending XHR requests or setting up complex audio graphs.  



Usage
---

The simplest use case is loading and playing a single audio file.  

<pre><code>var bell = new Wad({source : 'http://www.myserver.com/audio/bell.wav'})
bell.play()
bell.stop()</code></pre>


Behind the scenes, Wad sends an XMLHttpRequest to the source URL, so you will need a server running to respond to the request. You can't simply test it with local files, like you can with an HTML &lt;audio> tag.  

You can also create oscillators using the same syntax, by specifying 'sine', 'square', 'sawtooth', or 'triangle' as the source.

<pre><code>var saw = new Wad({source : 'sawtooth'})</code></pre>


The Wad constructor supports many optional arguments to modify your sound, from simple settings such as peak volume, to more powerful things like ADSR envelopes and filters.

<pre><code>var saw = new Wad({
